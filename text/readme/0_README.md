## Ignored folders
The data folder data/ is restricted and therefore not available

## Environment
To set up the conda environment, the file `code/environment.yaml` contains the necessary packages. R=To set up the environment, run
```
(module load miniconda3-4.5.4-gcc-5.4.0-hivczbz)
#conda env create --name snakemake-globalDA --file environment.yaml
conda create -n snakemake-globalDA -c conda-forge bioconda::snakemake bioconda::snakemake-minimal -c bioconda

```
to enter the environment, type

```
source activate snakemake-globalDA
...
conda deactivate
```


## Config file
first of all
`config_PCAWG_working.yaml`

snakemake -p ../data/restricted/pcawg/pcawg_restricted_snv/fec30898-f86b-4207-aa78-de77142c8f50.consensus.20160830.somatic.snv_mnv.vcf.gz.tbi


### Samples in PCAWG for which there are no VCFs
These files appear in the metadata and may have them in the mutccf file, but I don't have their VCF, which is the only file that contains what mutation it is (in mutccf you can have the position and CCF, but not mutation type).

../results/reports/faulty_samples


## Embedding genome, creating objects, running and analysing inference
### Modifying vcfs

0. Modify VCF files to get only the important information (position, mutation type), and add the flanking bases (embed to count space)
```
sh code/0_modify_vcf/get_flanking_and_mut.sh
```

Creates files with suffix `_merged`.


1. Create ROO objects
