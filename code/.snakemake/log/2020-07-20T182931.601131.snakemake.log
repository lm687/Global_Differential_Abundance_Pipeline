Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 69 of /Users/morril01/Documents/PhD/GlobalDA/code/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
../data/assessing_models_simulation/datasets/20200625_10_100_7_0_dataset.RDS
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
