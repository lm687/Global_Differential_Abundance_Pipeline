## Convergence of PCAWG samples in full-RE multinomial model

- the vast majority of samples have not converged
- this is especially the case for signatures
- signatures are, in general, more than 6, so it the problem is that there are too many categories and too few samples to comverge properly, this would explain it
- the problem in inference is that the gradient is too steep- Despite being non-pd, the simulated data from these models (with the inferred parameters) show a very good correlation with the observed data
- a possibility is that signatures with very low abundance are the problem, and that we should remove those prior to analysing the exposures
- using Head-SCC with signatures as an example, I am showing that using a subset of the exposures leads to correct, non-pd, inference, when using a full-RE multonimial
